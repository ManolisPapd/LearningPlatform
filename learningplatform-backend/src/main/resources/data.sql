SQL became a standard of the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986, and of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1987. As the name suggests, it is used when we have structured data (in the form of tables). All databases that are not relational (or do not use fixed structure tables to store data) and therefore do not use SQL, are called NoSQL databases. Examples of NoSQL are MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra, etc."

SQL is a set-based, declarative programming language, not an imperative programming language like C or BASIC. However, extensions to Standard SQL add procedural programming language functionality, such as control-of-flow constructs. In addition to the standard SQL/PSM extensions and proprietary SQL extensions, procedural and object-oriented programmability is available on many SQL platforms via DBMS integration with other languages. The SQL standard defines SQL/JRT extensions (SQL Routines and Types for the Java Programming Language) to support Java code in SQL databases. Microsoft SQL Server 2005 uses the SQLCLR (SQL Server Common Language Runtime) to host managed .NET assemblies in the database, while prior versions of SQL Server were restricted to unmanaged extended stored procedures primarily written in C. PostgreSQL lets users write functions in a wide variety of languagesâ€”including Perl, Python, Tcl, JavaScript (PL/V8) and C."

However, the standard''s specification of the semantics of language constructs is less well-defined, leading to ambiguity, many database vendors have large existing customer bases; where the newer version of the SQL standard conflicts with the prior behavior of the vendor''s database, the vendor may be unwilling to break backward compatibility, there is little commercial incentive for vendors to make it easier for users to change database suppliers, users evaluating database software tend to place other factors such as performance higher in their priorities than standards conformance."

It is good for storage and performance both, the more columns you use for primary key the more storage space you require. Inn terms of performance, less data means the database can process faster. Primary key enforces the entity integrity of the table, always has unique data, a primary key length cannot be exceeded than 900 bytes, a primary key cannot have null value, there can be no duplicate value for a primary key and a table can contain only one primary key constraint.

SQL Server provides three type of triggers: Data manipulation language (DML) triggers which are invoked automatically in response to INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE events against tables, Data definition language (DDL) triggers which fire in response to CREATE, ALTER, and DROP statements.
